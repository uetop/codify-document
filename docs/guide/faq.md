## Does the Codify plugin read my design files?

Codify does not save your design files or code. All parsing and rendering are done within the Codify plugin, which is a `JavaScript` program running in your browser.

## Does it access my Figma account information?

The Codify backend only records the account information and configuration data of users registered on the Codify website. It is not associated with your account information on Figma.

## Do I need to pay for it?

For the subscription version, it includes a comprehensive design system, a complete component library, code generation plugins, and a configuration management backend that supports team collaboration. Additionally, to cover server and bandwidth costs, we offer a very low price of $6.5/month for annual subscribers. This helps support ongoing improvements, and we greatly appreciate it.

Codify also offers a free plan, allowing you to generate HTML and CSS code. If this meets your requirements, you can use it completely free of charge.

## I subscribed to Codify's paid plan on Figma. Do I need to pay again on other platforms?

Codify accounts are separate from prototype design platform accounts. You can use your current account to log in on any supported platform and enjoy the same benefits.

Furthermore, if you switch from one project team to another, you do not need to subscribe again.

## I am a subscribed user. Do I need to pay again when joining another team?

Subscription privileges are associated with your account. If you are a subscribed user, you can enjoy Codify subscription benefits in any team.

## Are there team plans available?

Codify's payment plans are based on individual accounts. We do not limit you from creating multiple teams.

As a paid user, you receive priority consultation services. If you are an enterprise user, you will receive one free support session and can schedule one-on-one consultations at any time. We are committed to helping you solve problems and providing personalized guidance. Additionally, through the tutorials in this documentation, you can easily master the configuration file writing process.


## My configuration is not taking effect. What could be the issue?

First, make sure that the configuration not taking effect refers to the [Feature](/guide/feature-setting) and [Component parsing](/guide/component-parsers) not working. In such cases, check if your account has a paid subscription. Also, make sure to save the file and restart the plugin to reload the configuration file.

Check if the configuration is correct. You can also send an example of the Figma node that is not working (without sending the entire file) and the corresponding configuration code to service@codify.fun. We will assist you in resolving the issue.

If the above issues have been ruled out, it may be a bug in Codify itself. Please report it to us, and we will address and resolve the issue as soon as possible.
