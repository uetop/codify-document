# Codify

Codify is a figma plugin, that allows you to convert design files into various code formats such as React, Vue, HTML, CSS, and more. It is an efficient and advanced delivery tool.

::: details Why called Codify ?
 Codify it means to transform a concept, rule, or process into a series of explicit instructions. In the software domain, it can be interpreted as expressing a set of specifications or best practices in a systematic manner as executable code or programming rules. This software aligns closely with that concept, hence the name "Codify".

In addition to the Codify plugin, we have also developed a beautifully designed configuration management dashboard. It uses the Monaco Editor as the editor for configuration files and provides real-time code linting to check for code standards. You can simply press `Command / Ctrl + S` to save the configuration. Furthermore, the editor has an autosave feature that automatically saves your code in your browser storage, so even if you accidentally close the browser, your data will not be lost.
